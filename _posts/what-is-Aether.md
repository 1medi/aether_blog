The Aether team is tackling the issues that caregivers are facing when helping seniors fill out important documents. By using ai, we are making it easier for caregivers to help the seniors. We are creating an app that will simplify, summarize, and steamline the document filling process. The current state of the project is in early development with initial planning, ideation, and role orientation in completed. We are currently finalizing our logo and setting up our lo-fi prototype. Keep and eye on our blog to continue to see our progress!
