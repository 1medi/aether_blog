## What did we do?

In short we, had to identify our problems and solidify our solutions. We also had to confirm our key values ONCE AGAIN!!!!!

Them being: 

- Clarify 
- Summarize
- Streamline

## What Next?

Still a lot of work to do, including recording the actual commercial and coding of the application for the presentation next week.

Stay TUNED!
